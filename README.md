# Python tutorial
In this repository I have tried my attempt to solve common Python questions.
## List
Contained within a collection of square brackets `[ ]`, a list is defined as an ordered, mutable, and heterogeneous collection of objects.
To clarify: **order** implies that the gathering of objects follow a particular order **Mutable** means the list can be mutated or changed, and **heterogeneous** implies that weâ€™ll be able to mix and match any kind of object, or data type, within a list (int, float, or string).
### Some importatnt functions or methods in List:
* `sort()`: Sorts the list in ascending order.
* `type(list)`: It returns the class type of an object.
* `append()`: Adds one element to a list.
* `extend()`: Adds multiple elements to a list.
* `index()`: Returns the first appearance of a particular value.
* `max(list)`: It returns an item from the list with a max value.
* `min(list)`: It returns an item from the list with a min value.
* `len(list)`: It gives the overall length of the list.
* `clear()`: Removes all the elements from the list.
* `insert()`: Adds a component at the required position.
* `count()`: Returns the number of elements with the required value.
* `pop()`: Removes the element at the required position.
* `remove()`: Removes the primary item with the desired value.
* `reverse()`: Reverses the order of the list.
* `copy()`:  Returns a duplicate of the list.
* `all()`:  Returns `True` if all the elements of an iterable are true, or if the iterable is empty.
* `any()`:  Returns `True` if at least one item of the iterable is true. Unlike `all()`, it will return `False` if the iterable is empty.
* `filter()`: Method constructs an iterator from the items of iterables that satisfy a certain condition.
* `map()`: Maps a function to each item of iterables and returns an iterator.
* `zip()`: Returns an iterator that contains an aggregate of each item of the iterables.
* `enumerate()`: Adds a counter to an iterable and returns it.
## Dictionary
Declared by enclosing a comma-separated list of key-value pairs using curly braces `{}`. A Dictionary in Python is the unordered and changeable collection of data values that holds key-value pairs. Each key-value pair in the dictionary maps the key to its associated value making it more optimized. Instead of indices, the elements are stored using names or keys in the dictionaries.



### Conditional statements and loops:
